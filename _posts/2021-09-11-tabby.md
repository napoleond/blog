A while ago I wrote [Data practices for scrappy startups](/2020/09/02/data-practices-for-scrappy-startups.html) and it's been rolling around in my head ever since. Why _can't_ tiny startups have simple data tools that can grow with them?

Well, now they can :) I've been building [Tabby Data](https://www.tabbydata.com) in my nights and weekends for a while, and I'm really excited about everything that's there. Go try it out! (It's completely free for low-volume use-cases.)
