Whew! I can't believe it's been _months_ since my last post, and that this is my first post this year, but I have a good excuse: I've been busy!

When I first achieved my up-level to Staff, I had [many questions about what that even meant](https://davidnoelromas.com/2020/04/01/what-is-a-staff-engineer.html). One of the resources that lit the way for me was Will Larson's [staffeng.com](https://staffeng.com/), and recently it occurred to me that having the same sort of conversations in podcast format would be really fun and potentially valuable. So I contacted Will, and he expressed support. He also referred me to [Alex Kessinger](https://twitter.com/voidfiles) who Will had previously interviewed for the site, and who had also expressed interest in doing a podcast.

Alex and I jumped right into it, and the collaboration worked quite well right off the bat. We now have several interviews recorded, and the first episode is launching today. Please check it out at [podcast.staffeng.com](https://podcast.staffeng.com) and consider leaving a review on Apple Podcasts/your podcatcher of choice if you like it!
