There's a meme in my parts of the internet that it's important to "work in public." (I tried to find specific citations of this but timed out; the circle of the internet I'm thinking about is folks like [@robwalling](https://twitter.com/robwalling) and [@patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11) but I think the meme extends beyond those folks.) The phrase "working in public" is usually shorthand for "produce public artifacts, like blog posts or podcast episodes, as a byproduct of your work process" and the idea is that this will propel you toward the goals of your work by making you a better communicator, expanding your social network, etc.

I don't think this is bad advice; indeed, I'm currently writing a blog post, and have maintained a blogging practice in one form or another for most of my adult life. _However_, I no longer think that working in public is a superpower, and here's why: _empirically, the most accomplished people in any domain I can think of do not work in public_. Elon Musk? He has a very persona, but the inner workings of his companies are extremely private. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos? Ditto, basically. What about outside my weird little tech/business bubble? I'd argue this is true for artists, musicians, actors, and writers as well. Their work _product_ is extremely public but their _process_ is generally not. Conversely, if I think about people who are known for "working in public," they are generally _not_ the absolute best person around at _doing the work_. Indeed, often times the "informational byproduct" has become the work itself for these people, and there's nothing wrong with that--I and many others have learned tremendously from such people.

For myself, I am confident that my goal is not to work in public for its own sake, but rather to actually accomplish the work at an excellent level. Therefore, when I write in public it is mostly an exercise in improving my own communication skills, with a distant secondary goal of connecting with like-minded people.
