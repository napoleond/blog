Hey! Thanks for checking out my blog. I'm a staff-level software engineer who
works remotely for [Stripe](https://stripe.com). Prior to that, I worked
as a founder/early employee in several startups. Outside of my day job, I enjoy
playing music, brewing beer, and building [Tabby Data](https://www.tabbydata.com). I once
[cycled across Canada](http://bybike.ca).
